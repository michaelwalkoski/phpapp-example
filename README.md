# An Beginner's Guide to Developing PHP Applications with Distelli
In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to build, test, and deploy a PHP application using Distelli. PHP is one of many languages available, but it’s simplicity and flexibility make it a great place to begin. Many of the concepts you learn in in this tutorial will transfer to other languages and you’ll learn about setting up a website. Distelli also supports Java, Node.js, Phython, and Ruby.

The foundation of web development is the client-server relationship. You are the client when you enter a web address in your browser. The request is sent to the server and a file is returned to your browser to be displayed. The process is similar to opening a file on your computer, but in this case, it’s returned through the browser.

The difference between PHP and other languages like JavaScript is where they are executed. PHP applications are run on the server before being sent to your browser, while JavaScript is run on your computer. We call these server-side and client-side languages. Web programs can use both client and server languages, and with databases and other technologies, you can create powerful applications. But don’t worry, we’ll start with a simple calculator application and turn it into an app to calculate the cost of a cookie order.
